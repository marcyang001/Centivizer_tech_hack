this is the location where we temporarily store the csv files generate by the user 

the csv files allow the user to upload mulitple contents all in one csv file

After storing the contents of the CSV file in MongoDB, we delete that csv file. 

Here are the headers for the CSV file: 

imageUrl,
who,
year,
month,
where,
format,
question1,
q1_right,
q1_wrong1,
q1_wrong2,
q1_wrong3,
question2,
q2_right,
q2_wrong1,
q2_wrong2,
q2_wrong3
